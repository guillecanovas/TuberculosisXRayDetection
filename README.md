# Tuberculosis (TB) Detection System with Chest X-ray Images

This repository hosts a machine learning-based diagnostic system designed to detect Tuberculosis (TB) in patients using a dataset of chest X-ray images.

## Overview:

- **Objective:** The primary goal of this project is to develop an accurate diagnostic tool for detecting Tuberculosis (TB) by analyzing chest X-ray images.

- **Dataset:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/tuberculosis-tb-chest-xray-dataset

## Key Features:

- **Data Preprocessing:** The system includes image preprocessing steps to enhance the quality and usability of the chest X-ray images.

- **Model Training:** We utilize the dataset to train and fine-tune a diagnostic model capable of accurately detecting TB in X-ray images.

- **Evaluation Metrics:** The model's performance is assessed using relevant evaluation metrics.

- **Diagnostic Interface (To Do):** Future plans include the development of an interactive user interface, allowing users to upload chest X-ray images for TB detection.
