# Tuberculosis Detection System with Chest X-ray Images

This repository hosts a machine learning-based diagnostic system designed to detect Tuberculosis (TB) in patients using a dataset of chest X-ray images.

## Key Features:

- **Objective:** The primary goal of this project is to develop an accurate diagnostic tool for detecting Tuberculosis (TB) by analyzing chest X-ray images.

- **Dataset:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/tuberculosis-tb-chest-xray-dataset
  
- **Simple User Interface (To Do):** My plan is to provide an intuitive user interface to upload X-ray images and obtain instant classification results.
